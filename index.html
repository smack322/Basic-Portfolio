        <p>He is taking the UNH coding bootcamp to gain a better understanding of the development process as he works with developers on a day to day basis to ensure credentials are secured at rest. Also, he would like to apply some of the skills learned to help automate redundant tasks and to build security monitoring controls. He sees a lot of value in learning to code and is excited to build up some cool projects.</p>
